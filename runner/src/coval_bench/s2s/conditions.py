"""Which metrics each S2S caller condition carries.

A condition is one dataset id. ``required`` must be on the run or the run is a
fault; ``optional`` is written when present; anything named in neither is never
fetched, so its absence is silent rather than an alertable warning.

Dataset ids pair a family with a condition. The family is the Coval test set the
runs came from, so two sets' scenarios can never share a row key; the condition is
the caller persona's character within it.
