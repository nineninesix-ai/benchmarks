"""Who may see early-access models.

``EARLY_ACCESS`` models run on the normal schedule but are under embargo: every
data endpoint strips them unless the caller proves it may see them. The one
proof is a bearer Clerk session token (see ``clerk.py``): the coval org sees
everything, and a mapped provider org sees what its entry names. The grants
live in settings, so a request can never widen its own view.

An absent or unknown proof yields the public view — the endpoints stay public
either way, so there is nothing to 404 — and says so in ``X-EA-Token-Status``.
