# Coval Benchmarks

Public, open-source voice-AI benchmarking for STT and TTS providers. Runs on a schedule against a pinned dataset, writes results to Postgres, and surfaces them at [benchmarks.coval.ai](https://benchmarks.coval.ai). Licensed Apache-2.0 — clone, build, and run with your own provider API keys.

See [`runner/`](runner/) for setup and local-run instructions, or
[`docs/nineninesix-tts.md`](docs/nineninesix-tts.md) for a start-to-finish
Docker walkthrough of benchmarking a single TTS provider.

## Methodology

This is a research benchmark. Results reflect a specific pinned dataset, a
specific set of provider model versions, and a specific normalization pipeline.
Absolute numbers may not generalize to production workloads. Latency metrics
and per-provider drift over time are the most informative signals. See
[`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md) for the full reproducibility
contract.
